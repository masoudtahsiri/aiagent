# Git Workflow Instructions

## Branch Strategy
- Always work directly on the `main` branch
- Do NOT create feature branches
- After making changes, commit and push directly to `main`

## Push Workflow
When asked to "push" or when completing a task:
1. Stage changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with a descriptive message
3. Push directly to main: `git push origin main`

## Important
- Skip creating pull requests unless explicitly asked
- Push all commits directly to main branch
- Do not create branches like `claude/feature-name`
